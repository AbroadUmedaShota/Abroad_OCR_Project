### Implementation Proposal

To resolve this Issue, I will proceed with the planning and preparation for Beta Testing, Load Testing, and Release Candidate generation. The actual execution of these tests and the final release build will be conducted after this issue is completed.

**Files to be changed:**
- `SDD.md`
- `docs/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
- `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE.md`

#### 1. **Contribution to Project Goals**
- This change establishes the framework for comprehensive quality assurance and release management, crucial for delivering a stable and high-quality application as outlined in `SDD.md`.

#### 2. **Overview of Changes**
- I will update the `SDD.md` to include detailed plans for beta testing and load testing, as well as an overview of the release candidate preparation process. The project overview and architecture documents will also be updated to reflect these new phases.

#### 3. **Specific Work Content for Each File**
- `SDD.md`:
    - Update `9. テスト計画` to include sections for Beta Testing Plan (e.g., user recruitment, feedback collection) and Load Testing Plan (e.g., performance metrics, tools).
    - Update `10. CI/CD & デプロイ` to outline the process for building and distributing release candidates.
- `docs/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`:
    - Update `3. 主要機能 (Proof of Concept)` to mention the inclusion of beta testing, load testing, and release candidate preparation phases.
- `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE.md`:
    - Update relevant sections to reflect the planning for beta testing, load testing, and release candidate preparation.

#### 4. **Definition of Done**
- [ ] All necessary documentation updates have been implemented.
- [ ] The plans for beta testing, load testing, and release candidate preparation are clearly outlined in `SDD.md`.
- [ ] The project overview and architecture documents reflect these new phases.
- [ ] The implementation has been manually verified.
