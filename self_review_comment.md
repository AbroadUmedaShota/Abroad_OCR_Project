### Quality Gate Assessment

- **Computational Complexity:** The computational complexity of the implemented algorithm is appropriate. There is no more efficient method at this time.
- **Security:** The code does not contain basic vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS.
- **Scalability:** The implementation is scalable enough to accommodate future feature additions and changes.

### Design Trade-offs

The CI/CD pipeline was modified to use `python` commands instead of `npm` commands to align with the project's technology stack. This improves consistency and maintainability.
