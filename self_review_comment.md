### Quality Gate Assessment

- **Computational Complexity:** This issue primarily involves documentation updates and planning. There are no direct code changes that impact computational complexity.
- **Security:** The changes are limited to documentation and planning. No new security vulnerabilities are introduced.
- **Scalability:** The updated documentation outlines plans for load testing, which will address scalability concerns in future phases.

### Design Trade-offs

The primary trade-off in this issue was to focus on planning and documentation for beta testing, load testing, and release candidate preparation, rather than implementing any new code. This ensures that these critical phases are well-defined and integrated into the project roadmap before execution. This aligns with the iterative development approach outlined in `SDD.md`.
